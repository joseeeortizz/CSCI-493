The project is due to May 20 (11:59 pm).

The program should be submitted ONLY via GradeScope.
No late submissions.
The project is meant for individual work only. My “questions about the project” policy is in place. Using AI, copilot or similar tools isn’t considered an individual work.
All your source and header files should start with a comment with your name in it. If I find any that doesn’t, I penalize it.
The solution should build and work. MPI should work.

In this assignment, we practice a basic MPI usage.
You should write a C++ and MPI program that solves a system of N linear equations with N variables using the method of Gaussian elimination.
Gaussian elimination is a classical parallel computing application, and it is a very nice way to practice MPI programming.We care mostly for the parallel programming part of this assignment and a little bit less for the mathematical part, so I suggest the following simplifying conditions for your assignment:
* the system of linear equations that your program solves will always have exactly one solution.
* for the system of linear equations that your program solves there will be no need to swap rows
However, even though our main interest here is MPI, I expect you to understand Gaussian elimination, and it can potentially appear on the final exam.

A system of linear equations to be solved will be supplied in a binary file. The name of file will be provided in the first command line argument. The format of the file is the following:
* file starts with an unsigned int that states the problem size N.
* then there go N series of (N+1) double numbers where each series represents a row of an augmented matrix.

The result should be written in the binary file with the name provided in the second command line argument. The format of the file should be the following:
* file starts with an unsigned int that states the problem size N.
* then there go N double numbers that represent the solution. Solution value should be written in the correct order.

Good luck!
